> DBDSF is an application to help people quit smoking through connection. It takes two things to work: 1) a desire to quit smoking and 2) three friends.

## Usage

> The core premise behind DBDSF is that the true cure for addiction is connection. On DBDSF, a smoker signs up for the program, and gives us the mobile number for three of their friends. DBDSF will check in with each smoker twice a day, and relay to the smokers' friends whether they smoked.
